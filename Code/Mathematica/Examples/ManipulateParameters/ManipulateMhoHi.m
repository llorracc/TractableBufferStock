Note that even in regions were the relationship between \[Mho] and the target wealth-income ratio is negative, the relationship between \[Mho] and the SAVING RATE is positive; this is illustrated by the following figure.  The negative relationship between \[Mho] and the ratio reflects the fact that growth is adjusted upward as \[Mho] rises in order to keep the PDV of labor income constant; faster net growth (for the continuing-employed) means that it is harder to maintain a given ratio of wealth to income.
