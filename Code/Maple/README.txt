Maple is proprietary software and does not have a free reader, so the worksheets can be used only with a valid Maple installation. 

The Maple folder contains a Maple worksheet produced with version 16.01 standard interface (extension .mw).

The Maple folder contains a Maple worksheet converted to the classic interface (extension .mws). Try this if you have problems with the standard interface.

The Maple folder contains a text-only version of the code (extension .mpl), which can be read with any text editor. 

The Maple folder contains a portable document format version of the computed worksheet (extension .pdf), which shows the output as well.

The Maple code for all simulations is contained in a single worksheet. A parameter configuration may be selected at the top of the worksheet (by setting the value of N to 1,2,3,4,5), before running the worksheet from top to bottom. For each parameter configuration N, a folder named N is needed to store the results of the computation. If the folder does not exist, no output is produced. Thus, if you select N:=1; you must have a folder named "1" in the same directory.

Parameter configurations other than the existing ones may be created, but note that the appearance of the figures, while flexible, is tailored to the existing configurations. Labels may overlap or disappear from the figure in some extreme cases. An alternative to the labels is to show the legends, by un-commenting the lines in front of 'legend' and 'legendstyle'. The 'view' may also be tweaked.
