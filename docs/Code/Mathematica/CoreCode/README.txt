This directory contains the "core" code used for all of the partial equilibrium Tractable model solutions.

MakeAnalyticalResults.m -- Derives analytical solutions for the level of consumption and derivatives 
Vars.m --  Defines those variables which are analytical functions of deeper parameters
Funcs.m -- Defines the functions that actually solve the model

Results for particular papers (e.g. ctDiscrete or cssUSSaving) are found in the "Examples" directory
