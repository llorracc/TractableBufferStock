Mathematica code for solving the Tractable buffer stock model
Requires Mathematica version 6 or higher

CoreCode -- Functions and parameters for solving the model

Examples -- Notebooks that use the CoreCode to produce figures,
including the figures for solution and simulation of the individual's
problem. To produce the main set of figures, open TractableBufferStock/IndividualsProblem.nb.

Manipulates -- Notebooks that allow the user to manipulate parameters
and see how the phase diagram changes
